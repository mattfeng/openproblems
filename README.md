A list of problems that have yet to be solved.


## Problem list
* **Stability of continental ice sheets.** (`climate`)
* **Role of the deep ocean in climate change.** (`climate`)

* **Cost-competitive long-term energy storage.** Advanced batteries, fuel cells, thermal storage, clean hydrogen systems. Which will be able to be produced _en masse_ for long-term, safe storage of energy? (`energy`, `climate`)
* **Scalable low-carbon firm electricity generation.** (`energy`, `climate`)
* **Low-carbon manufacturing processes for cement and steel.** (`materials`, `climate`)
* **Viable alternatives to cement and steel.**
* **Long-distance low-carbon transportation, land and see.**
* **Low-carbon aviation.**
* **Carbon capture, sorage, and utilization.**

* **Climate models with sufficient resolution.** Scientific models enable us to quantify predictions for future climate risks. However, current models do not have the spatial and temporal resolution (due to limitations in computing resources) to reliably predict future climate risks at local scale (e.g. heat waves, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, droughts).
* **Climate-friendly city design.**
* **Applications of hydrocarbons without greenhouse gas emissions.** This would offer economic hope for fossil fuel companies and their employees.

* **Digital archiving.** Lots of tools and knowledge is on the web, but eventually rots because it is not maintained. Is it possible to maintain tools (e.g. biology software) so that it remains in use, or that it knowledge content is preserved? (`compsci`, `archive`)

## Grand Challenges
* MIT Climate Grand Challenge ([http](http://climategrandchallenges.mit.edu/), [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZC3KisCiorthNfsMV27ooaYZW4CnXVpE7PKpGmQnusPR))
