A list of problems that have yet to be solved.


## Problem list
* **Stability of continental ice sheets.** (`climate`)
* **Role of the deep ocean in climate change.** (`climate`)

* **Cost-competitive long-term energy storage.** Advanced batteries, fuel cells, thermal storage, clean hydrogen systems. Which will be able to be produced _en masse_ for long-term, safe storage of energy? (`energy`, `climate`)
* **Scalable low-carbon firm electricity generation.** (`energy`, `climate`)
* **Low-carbon manufacturing processes for cement and steel.** (`materials`, `climate`)
* **Viable alternatives to cement and steel.**
* **Long-distance low-carbon transportation, land and see.**
* **Low-carbon aviation.**
* **Carbon capture, storage, and utilization.**
* **Climate models with sufficient resolution.** Scientific models enable us to quantify predictions for future climate risks. However, current models do not have the spatial and temporal resolution (due to limitations in computing resources) to reliably predict future climate risks at local scale (e.g. heat waves, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, droughts).
* **Climate-friendly city design.**
* **Applications of hydrocarbons without greenhouse gas emissions.** This would offer economic hope for fossil fuel companies and their employees.
* **Digital archiving.** Lots of tools and knowledge is on the web, but eventually rots because it is not maintained. Is it possible to maintain tools (e.g. biology software) so that it remains in use, or that it knowledge content is preserved? (`compsci`, `archive`)

### Genomics
* How do all the genes in the genome work together to transform a fertilized egg into an adult organism?
* How do genetic variants at hundreds or even thousands of genes control the yield of crop plants?
* How can genetics guide both the prevention and treatment of cancer, autism, and other diseases?
* How do cells manage to seamlessly orchestrate the complex array of interacting genes and biochemical reactions that are found within them?
* How do genes give humans the capacity for language and consciousness?

### Education
#### Improving education
* What makes improving the quality of education difficult?
    * One thing that makes improving education tricky is that even among people who work on the issue, there isn't much agreement on what works and what doesn't. (e.g. in health, we know that vaccines work; in education, we don't know exactly what works.)
    * Scaling education solutions doesn't mean applying the same solution to everyone.

## Grand Challenges
* MIT Climate Grand Challenge ([http](http://climategrandchallenges.mit.edu/), [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZC3KisCiorthNfsMV27ooaYZW4CnXVpE7PKpGmQnusPR))
